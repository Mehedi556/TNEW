            what is the Difference of “var” vs “let” vs “const” in Javascript
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
            <p>var can do so many things since the variable declared under var can be scoped globally and locally, or you might heard of the term “function scope”. For instance,<br>Global scope means a variable can be scoped outside of the function since it is defined outside of the function, while local scope means a variable is defined inside the function locally, therefore that variable cannot be called outside of the function.. <br>We can also update the var variable if you want. <br>We can redeclare the var variable as well.
                <br><br>
                Let works quite similar tovar, except let is block-scoped. A block is referring to anything within the curly braces {}.
                <br><br>
                const is quite self-explanatory. const variables maintain constant values. While the nature of const is quite different from let , they both share a lot of similarities.
        
        Like let declarations, const is block-scoped. I hope the above examples clarify what block-scoped is.
        
        const declarations, like let , are not initialized when they are hoisted to the top.
        
        const cannot be redeclared, just like let. But the difference from let is const cannot be updated.

            Difference Between Arrow Function and Regular Function
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>

            1) Arguments binding
            arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. <br>
            The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn’t define arguments i.e. they do not have arguments binding.But you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args.
            <br><br>
            2) Use of this keyword
Inside of a regular JavaScript function, this value is dynamic. The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked.
<br>The behavior of this inside of an arrow, function differs considerably from the regular function’s this behavior as an arrow function does not have its own “this” keyword.

The value of this inside an arrow function remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest non-arrow parent function which means No matter how or where being executed, this value inside of an arrow function always equals this value from the outer function.

            .forEach(), .map(), .filter(), .find .... What's the difference?
        </div>
        <div class="collapse-content"> 
          <p>.forEach(),<br> is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
            <br><br>
            .map(): <br>
.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.

<br><br>

.filter(): <br>
.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
<br><br>
.find() <br>
The find() method returns the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.
